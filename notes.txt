KMEAN NOTES

-the mnist-reader is opensource and has some issues; but it worked for this purpose (i.e needs further evaluation)

-had few options for the structure of response, for simplicity and time reasons chose the most straight forward option (not so generic coding there).

-restricted user input for compatability purposes

-low quality code at front app due to lack of knowledge + time consumption

-array of integers to be displayed as grayscale image (thought about passing bmp images from server : did not do it due to time restrictions) - not simple via JS

-image resizing needed

-cluster visual bug

-angular requires too much of a setup for this kind of project
